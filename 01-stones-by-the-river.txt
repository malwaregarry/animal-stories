Stones by the river

Two bears were walking by the river when one spotted a stone glistening on the riverbed.
 
"That’s a nice looking stone," said the bear
He picks up the stone. 
"I think that’s the nicest stone I’ve seen so far," he said

"What’s so nice about that stone? Looks like every other stone," said the other bear

"Look–it’s shiny and smooth and has this funky almond shape. Can’t get any better than that."

Bear 2 picks up another stone. 
"What about this? It’s shiny and smooth and has a similar funky shape."

"That one is nice, but it doesn’t have the same sparkle," said Bear 1

"Well I think I like mine more than yours," said Bear 2

They continued on their way, each with their stone.
