The climb

A goat was making his way up a mountain. 
It was a tall mountain, with a beautiful view at the top. 
After some time, he came across a clearing.   

This looks like a good spot for a break, he thought

He sat down and rested. 
He could see the forest, the river and a glimpse of the sea. 

I really like this spot,
I wonder how much better the view is at the top.

But he was still weary, and the path would only get steeper.
He wanted to continue, but it seemed smarter to head back down.

The climb down was slow and difficult.
But when he got home, he found himself smiling.
