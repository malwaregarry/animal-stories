Grazing grass

Two sheep were out in the field.

"There is grass everywhere, and each patch tastes a little different," said Sheep 1
"I want to try them all."

“How are you planning to manage that?” asked Sheep 2

"I just have to eat until I’ve tasted every last one."

"But there is so much. And more grows every day."
"It doesn’t sound like you can finish eating them all."

"Ah," said Sheep 1, "imagine all the rare flavours I might miss!"

"Ah," said Sheep 2, "but imagine having no more grass to graze."

Sheep 1 fell silent.
"I would be very sad."
