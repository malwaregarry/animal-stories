Sharing seeds 

Two birds were in their nest, sharing the seeds they had gathered earlier. 
They divided the seeds equally between themselves.

After a while, one bird finished their portion.
"That wasn’t nearly enough,” they said. “I’m still hungry."

"Here, you can have some of mine," said the other.

"Are you sure? You’ll have little left."

"Of course! We’re good friends after all."

"But would you still share, even if we weren’t friends?" asked Bird 1.

"Yes, I would," said Bird 2. 
"And that’s how we’ll become friends."
