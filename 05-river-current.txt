River current

A carp was swimming in the river, carried along by a steady current.

A tortoise, resting by the bank, spotted the carp.
"Do you ever feel trapped by the current?" the tortoise called out.
"You do not have a choice in where you end up."

"I do not feel trapped,” the carp replied.
"The river brings me where I want to go."

"But you cannot move freely.” 
"I have feet, and that gives me control over my path."

"I, too, have control," said the carp. 
"I choose to follow the river."

"But how can you be sure that the river knows the way?"

"Then tell me—do your feet always lead you true?"
