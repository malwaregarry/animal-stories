Shifts

In a peaceful meadow lived a community of animals. 
Some took on the duty of guards to protect it.

At sunrise, a guard dog finished his shift and went back home.
The noise stirred a fox, which also lived inside.

“Sorry for waking you,” the dog mumbled.
 
“It’s alright, I was already awake,” the fox replied. 
“How was your shift? Must have been tiring.”

“Yeah…” the guard said, closing his eyes.
“I think I’ll take a nap now.”

“Good night,” the fox said, though the dog couldn’t hear it. 
“Now, I’ll be the one to keep you safe.”
