Wounded from a fall

A monkey was making his way in the forest, swinging from branch to branch. 
He grabbed hold of a brittle branch; it snapped, sending him tumbling down.

The fall was severe—he landed awkwardly and injured his back.
It hurt when he moved, and he was forced to rest.

That was careless of me, he thought to himself.
I’m going to be late. How will I explain this?

He focused on nursing his injury.
After a few days, he had healed enough to continue his journey.

Yet, even though his body had recovered, he still felt awful from the fall.
