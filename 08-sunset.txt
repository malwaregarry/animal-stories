Sunset

A cub was in the forest when the sun began to set.
Soon, the forest would be in darkness.

Without the light, the cub knew he wouldn’t be able to find his way.
It was best to head back while there was still time.

What a shame!
So much left undone, 
so many faces he had hoped to see once more.

But there was nothing he could do.
He couldn’t stop the sun from sinking. 

He turned and walked away, 
and waited for the promise of a new day.
