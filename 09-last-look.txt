Last look

A caterpillar was on a tree branch.
The day had come for her to chrysalise. 

She had long dreaded this moment.
No one truly knew what happened insideâ€”
only that wings might follow.

Never would she see her friends and family again,
and unspoken words would forever remain unsaid.

After one final look at the world she knew, 
she climbed onto a higher branch 
and surrendered to the change.

And on the branches below
the ones who loved her watched with heavy hearts,
as she disappeared from view.
