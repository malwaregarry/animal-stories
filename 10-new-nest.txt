New nest

Two birds were building a nest in the branches of a tree.
Though still unfinished, they pictured it whole.

Then a gust of wind swept through the tree,
and in a breath, the nest was gone.

One bird watched as twigs and grass scattered across the forest floor.
He felt a sharp ache inside him.
There was no other way—they had to start again.

“But it won’t be the same,” said the bird.
The nest he had pictured so clearly was gone; 
the shape of it hollowed from his mind.

“But it doesn’t have to be the same,” said the other bird.
“Yesterday it looked different than it did today.
It was always changing. Even before the wind.” 

They flew down together to gather what remained,
and began again—a different nest, but still theirs.
