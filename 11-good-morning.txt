Good morning

A hare lay in his burrow, trying to fall asleep.
It had been a tiring day, though not particularly fulfilling. 
Nothing felt in control; much was left undone.

He dozed in and out, sleep never fully arriving.
And before long, it was already time to wake.

The rooster’s call pierced the morning stillness.
“Good morning!” the rooster crowed.
The sound startled the hare, who was still lost in thought.

Would today be different? 
the hare wondered, stepping out of his burrow.

The sun was rising. 
It was a new day—similar in shape, yet different in manything else.
“Yes,” said the hare. “Good morning.”
