Flowers

A squirrel came upon a field of flowers.
Mesmerised, he stepped closer, taking in the blooms, 
each unique in shape, size, and scent.

A rabbit, who tended the field, noticed him lingering.
"Why don’t you pick one you like and take it home?" said the rabbit.

The squirrel grinned and began his search.
He wandered among the flowers,
discovering each new one lovelier than the last.

At last, he chose one—the crown flower.
He picked it up and thanked the rabbit,
though he wondered if another might have been better.

Back home, the rabbit placed the flower in a vase.
And from the moment it stood there on his table,
the flowers he left behind began to fade.
